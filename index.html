		<h4 class="tagline">Distinguished Engineer @ <a href="https://jobs.comcast.com/">Comcast</a></h4>

	  <p class="about-me">I enjoy building/motivating teams and ramping up new projects using the latest patterns and web primitives.
			 At Comcast I have led development on many major projects including
			 <a href="https://home.xfinity.com/" target="_blank">XFINITY Home</a> and
			 <a href="https://internet.xfinity.com/" target="_blank">XFINITY xFi</a>.
			 Outside of Comcast I am a <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-chris-lorenzo">Google Developer Expert</a>
			 in Web Technologies and I love hiking and chilling on the beach.
