# Welcome to Chiefhackers Website!

### Hello! :wave:

This is my personal site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Sustain](https://github.com/jekyller/sustain/) theme.

It serves as an example on how to create a PWA from a personal website and also to keep track of my speaking engagements.

The manifest.json tells browsers what to do when your site is installed on mobile or desktop. You can find more info: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/ and https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/
